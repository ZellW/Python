    "# Restaurant Review Prediction Project Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The restaurant industry is tougher than ever, with reviews on the Internet from day one of opening a restaurant. But as a food lover, you and a friend decide to enter the industry and open your own restaurant. Since a restaurant's success is highly correlated with its reputation, you want to make sure it has the best reviews on the most consulted restaurant rating and review site: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/\" target=\"blank\">Yelp!</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you know your food will be delicious, you believe there are other factors that influence the Yelp rating that will ultimately determine the success of your business. With a dataset of different restaurant characteristics and your Yelp stars, you decide to use a Multiple Linear Regression model to investigate which factors most affect a restaurant review and predict the number of stars on Yelp for your restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will work with a real data set provided by Yelp. We have provided six files, which are listed below with a brief description:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a large amount of data. The idea of this challenge is that you can simulate a real project environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `yelp_business.json`: establishment data related to the location and attributes of all the companies in the dataset.\n",
    "* `yelp_review.json`: metadata of the ratings per company.\n",
    "* `yelp_user.json`: user profile metadata per company\n",
    "* `yelp_checkin.json`: online billing metadata per company\n",
    "* `yelp_tip.json`: tips metadata per company\n",
    "* `yelp_photo.json`: photo metadata per company'\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several sources for Yelp data.  Yelp hosts data [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).  Kaggle also provides a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset).  I am uncertain what the specific differences are between the 2 sources, if any.\n",
